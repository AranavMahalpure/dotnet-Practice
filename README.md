set up the Environment in Laptop
Datatypes in C#
Constants
Hello World program
Readonly and Constant
Type casting (Implicit and Explicit)

C# Learning - Day 2  (ravindra devrani)
Date: 30/3/2024

Today, I continued my C# learning journey with the following topics:

Operators
C# supports various types of operators, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and miscellaneous operators.

Conditional Statements
I learned about conditional statements, including if, else, else if, and the switch statement. These statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.

Loops
C# provides several loop constructs, such as for, foreach, while, and do-while loops. These loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a given condition.

Jump Statements
Jump statements, like break, continue, and return, are used to alter the flow of a loop or a method.

Strings
I learned about strings in C#, which are sequences of characters. I also explored various string manipulation methods and the StringBuilder class.

Practice Set
I solved a few practice problems to get hands-on experience with the concepts I learned today.

OOPs Concepts
Classes and Methods
I learned about classes and methods in C#, which are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and a method is a block of code that defines the behavior of an object.

Access Modifiers
I learned about access modifiers in C#, such as public, private, protected, internal, and protected internal. These modifiers are used to control the accessibility of class members.

Constructors
I learned about constructors in C#, which are special methods that are used to initialize objects.

Properties
I explored properties in C#, which are used to encapsulate the data of an object and provide a way to access and modify it.

Using System and Namespaces
I learned about the using System statement and namespaces in C#, which are used to organize and manage code.

Interfaces and Abstract Classes
I learned about interfaces and abstract classes in C#, which are used to define contracts and common behavior for classes.

In the next session, I plan to learn more about advanced C# concepts, such as LINQ, delegates, events, and asynchronous programming.
