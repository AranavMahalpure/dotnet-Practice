C# Learning - Day 1
Today, we started learning C#, which is used in .NET development. We covered the following topics:

Data Types
Basic data types: int, float, double, char, bool
string data type for representing text
Constants
Using the const keyword to declare a constant value
Constants cannot be reassigned
Hello World Program
Writing a simple program to print "Hello World" to the console
Read-Only
Declaring a variable as readonly to prevent it from being reassigned
readonly variables can be initialized only in the constructor
Type Casting
Implicit Type Casting: Automatically converting one data type to another, if the conversion is allowed
Explicit Type Casting: Manually converting one data type to another, by using a cast operator
Examples
int a = 10;
const double PI = 3.14;
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
readonly string Name = "John Doe";
int b = (int)3.14;
