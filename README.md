C# Learning - Day 1  29/3/2024 (Ravindra Devrani)

I also started learning C# which is used in .NET development. I learned about:
set up the Environment in Laptop
Datatypes in C#
Constants
Hello World program
Readonly and Constant
Type casting (Implicit and Explicit)

C# Learning - Day 2  (ravindra devrani)
Date: 30/3/2024

Today, I continued my C# learning journey with the following topics:

Operators
C# supports various types of operators, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and miscellaneous operators.

Conditional Statements
I learned about conditional statements, including if, else, else if, and the switch statement. These statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.

Loops
C# provides several loop constructs, such as for, foreach, while, and do-while loops. These loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a given condition.

Jump Statements
Jump statements, like break, continue, and return, are used to alter the flow of a loop or a method.

Strings
I learned about strings in C#, which are sequences of characters. I also explored various string manipulation methods and the StringBuilder class.

Practice Set
I solved a few practice problems to get hands-on experience with the concepts I learned today.

OOPs Concepts
Classes and Methods
I learned about classes and methods in C#, which are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and a method is a block of code that defines the behavior of an object.

Access Modifiers
I learned about access modifiers in C#, such as public, private, protected, internal, and protected internal. These modifiers are used to control the accessibility of class members.

Constructors
I learned about constructors in C#, which are special methods that are used to initialize objects.

Properties
I explored properties in C#, which are used to encapsulate the data of an object and provide a way to access and modify it.

Using System and Namespaces
I learned about the using System statement and namespaces in C#, which are used to organize and manage code.

Interfaces and Abstract Classes
I learned about interfaces and abstract classes in C#, which are used to define contracts and common behavior for classes.

In the next session, I plan to learn more about advanced C# concepts, such as LINQ, delegates, events, and asynchronous programming.

C# Learning - Day 3  (ravindra devrani)
Date: 31/3/2024

Interfaces and Abstract Classes
Learned about interfaces and abstract classes in C#, which are used to define contracts and common behavior for classes.

Exception Handling in C#
Understood how to handle errors and exceptions in C# using try, catch, and finally blocks.

Collection Frameworks in C#
Explored various collection frameworks in C#, such as lists, arrays, dictionaries, and hash sets.

Arrays in C#
Learned about arrays in C#, which are used to store multiple values of the same data type.

Enum Index
Understood the concept of enum index in C#, which is used to access the underlying value of an enum constant.

Delegates
Learned about delegates in C#, which are used to define callback methods and event handlers.

Generic Delegates
Understood the concept of generic delegates in C#, which are used to create type-safe delegates.

Multithreading
Learned about multithreading in C#, which is used to execute multiple threads of execution concurrently.

Async/Await and Task in C#
Understood how to use async/await and Task in C# to create asynchronous methods and handle asynchronous operations.

What I Learned Today
Today, I continued my C# learning journey with the following topics:
Interfaces and abstract classes
Exception handling
Collection frameworks
Arrays
Enum index
Delegates
Generic delegates
Multithreading
Async/await and Task
Practice Set
Practiced solving problems related to the concepts I learned today.

Next Session
In the next session, I plan to learn more about advanced C# concepts, such as LINQ, event handling, and more.
